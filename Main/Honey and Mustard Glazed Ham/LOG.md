* Used a 2.5kg ham
* Made glaze with honey, mustard, sugar, and some boiled-ham-juice (didn't have any oranges)
* Really do use wholegrain mustard for the glaze (boiled water + Colemans is liquid pain and suffering)
* Foil the roasting tray, unless you want to be chiselling off glaze for the next week
