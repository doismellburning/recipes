* Used granulated sugar instead of caster sugar, light brown muscovado instead of light brown soft - worked nicely
* Made walnut-ish sized balls, and they expanded quite a bit and stuck together a bit (though separated easily)
* Didn't use salt

## 2013/08/12

* Same as before, but tripled the recipe
* Left some in for 12 mins - came out quite golden, and a bit crunchy / "caramelised" / "burnt-tasting"
* Left most in for 10 - deliciously gooey
