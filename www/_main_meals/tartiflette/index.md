## Ingredients

* 1kg Charlotte potatoes, peeled
* 250g bacon lardons
* 2 shallots
* 1 garlic clove
* 100ml white wine
* 200ml double cream
* salt and pepper
* 450g Reblochon cheese, sliced

## Method

* Preheat the oven to 200C
* Cook the potatoes in a pan of salted water for 5-10 minutes or until tender
* Drain and set aside
* Heat a frying pan and fry the bacon and shallots and garlic for 4-5 minutes or until golden brown
* Deglaze the pan with the wine and continue to cook until most of the liquid has evaporated
* Slice the potatoes thinly and layer into an ovenproof gratin dish with the bacon mixture
* Pour over the cream, season with salt and lots of pepper
* Layer the Reblochon on top
* Bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese golden brown

## Notes

* The first time I made this, I undercooked the potatoes (the bacon mixture cooked a lot faster, the potatoes felt like they were taking *ages*). This was sad. Slicing before boiling appears to work much better.
* I've yet to make this with Reblochon/shallots due to laziness/convenience - cheddar and onions appear to work perfectly well.
* It's a resilient recipe, so I'm lazy with measurements - I use 350g cheese, 300ml cream and 225g lardons, because those are the packaged units
