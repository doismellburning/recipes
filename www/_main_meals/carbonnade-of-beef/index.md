## Method

* Preheat the oven to 150°C, gas mark 2. Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the meat in two or three batches and brown all over for 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a plate and season.
* Add the onions, with a little more oil if necessary, and sauté, stirring constantly, for 3-4 minutes or until lightly coloured.
* Reduce the heat and stir in the flour, with the sugar and vinegar, for 1 minute.
* Pour in about half the beer, stirring the bottom to loosen any residue.
* Transfer to a casserole dish and gradually add the remaining beer and the stock.
* Stir constantly until the liquid is thick and smooth and comes to the boil. Then reduce the heat and simmer for a couple of minutes.
* Add the beef and stir. Place the bouquet garni and garlic in the middle, immersing completely. Cover the casserole, transfer it to the oven and cook for about 2 hours, or until the beef is tender.
* Take the casserole out of the oven and remove and discard the bouquet garni and garlic. Spread the bread thickly with mustard and place the slices mustard side-up on top of the casserole, pressing down lightly to immerse slightly. Return to the oven uncovered and cook at 220°C for 15 minutes, or until the bread is crisp at the edges. Serve with rice and steamed broccoli.

## Cook's tips

Alternatively, cook the carbonnade covered, on the hob, for 1-2 hours on a low heat, stirring occasionally. Take care not to let it boil. Finish in the oven as described in step 4. To freeze, make to the end of step 3, allow to cool then freeze. Defrost in the fridge for 24 hours. Place the dish on the hob on a low heat and bring to a simmer. Add the croûtes and finish as directed in step 4.
