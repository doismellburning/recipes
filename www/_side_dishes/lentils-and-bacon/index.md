title: Lentils and Bacon
---

Based on a recipe from [Nigel Slater's The 30-Minute Cook](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141029528/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0141029528&linkCode=as2&tag=blogdoismellb-21&linkId=HU2QCB6CZOLM7S34),
but even simpler - lardons from the freezer, lentils from the cupboard - one of my favourite comfort foods.

Serves 2 - not a large amount, but filling

## Ingredients

* Lardons
* 100g red split lentils

## Method

* Rinse the lentils under cold water
* Fry the lardons until soft and verging on crispy
* Add the lentils and enough water to cover by a cm or so
* Boil until verging on dry
