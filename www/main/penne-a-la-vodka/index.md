## Log

### 2014-11-16

* Made the Italian sausagemeat with English sausagemeat, worked ok (but took a long time to brown to a happy level)
* Failed at "keeping the pasta warm"; next time will try to time pasta to be done when sauce is
* Used whole 300ml tub of whipping cream
* Used whole bag of spinach
* Didn't use any garlic or red pepper flakes
