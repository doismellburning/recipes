The secret to getting gloriously puffed-up Yorkshires is to have the fat sizzling hot â€“ and don't open the oven door!

## Cooking time

Prep: 5 mins Cook: 20 mins

## Servings

Makes 8 large puds or 24 small

## Ingredients

* 140g plain flour (this is about 200ml/7fl oz)
* 4 eggs (200ml/7fl oz)
* 200ml milk
* sunflower oil, for cooking

## Method

1. Heat oven to 230C/fan 210C/gas 8. Drizzle a little sunflower oil evenly into 2 x 4-hole Yorkshire pudding tins or a 12-hole non-stick muffin tin and place in the oven to heat through.
2. To make the batter, tip 140g plain flour into a bowl and beat in four eggs until smooth. Gradually add 200ml milk and carry on beating until the mix is completely lump-free. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the batter into a jug, then remove the hot tins from the oven. Carefully and evenly pour the batter into the holes. Place the tins back in the oven and leave undisturbed for 20-25 mins until the puddings have puffed up and browned. Serve immediately. You can now cool them and freeze for up to 1 month.
