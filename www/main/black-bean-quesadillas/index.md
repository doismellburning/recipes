## Servings

2, with some to spare

## Method

1. Mix beans, sweetcorn, chopped onion, crushed garlic, grated cheese, seasoning
1. Place around a cup onto half of a tortilla, fold over
1. Fry on each side until golden brown and the cheese has melted

## Notes

* Original recipe used fresh coriander; I never have any
* Don't skimp on the cheese, or else the fried quesadilla will come apart and they'll be tedious to turn over
* Fry some onion + mince and mix in too for more bulk
