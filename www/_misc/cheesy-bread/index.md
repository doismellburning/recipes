title: Gerald the Duck's Cheesy Bread
---

## Ingredients

* 1 tsp yeast
* 500 g Allinson's extra-strong white flour
* 2 tsp white sugar
* 25 g President unsalted butter
* 2 tsp Marvel powdered milk
* 1.5 tsp salt
* 175 g McLelland Seriously Strong cheddar
* 75 g Parmesan
* 0.5 tsp cayenne pepper
* 0.5 tsp black pepper
* 0.25 tsp Holland & Barrett vitamin C powder
* 350 ml water

Put ingredients in a breadmaker (Panasonic SD253) and set it going (bake large white loaf, light crust).

## Notes

* This is an incredible loaf of bread, and the result of prolonged experimentation by the author to make "absolutely the cheesiest bread I could work out how to make while still getting a loaf rather than a housebrick". Eat it, enjoy it, and be awed.
* Original recipe calls for 1/3 tsp cayenne pepper but I didn't have anything the right size, and am quite happy with 1/2.
