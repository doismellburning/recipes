title: Italian Sausagemeat
---

Because buying Italian Sausages in the UK is less trivial than it seems in the US

## Servings

80

## Ingredients

* 9kg pork mince
* 2 tbsp salt
* 4 tbsp garlic salt
* 1 tbsp black pepper
* 8 tbsp ground paprika
* 250ml vegetable oil
* 1 tbsp anise seed
* 1 tbsp fennel seed
* 3 tbsp dried chilli flakes

## Method

* Mix
* Refrigerate for 24h to let flavours blend

## Notes

* Works with sausagemeat instead of pork mince - crumbles a lot more nicely, but takes much longer to brown
* The 24h wait isn't critical
