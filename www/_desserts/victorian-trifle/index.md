## Ingredients

### Custard

* 3 large egg yolks
* 25g cornflour
* 50g caster sugar
* 600ml milk
* 300ml single cream

### Filling

* 16 trifle sponges
* 0.5 jars strawberry jam
* 10 amaretti
* 800g tin of pear halves in natural juice or light syrup
* 250ml madeira
* 175g red seedless grapes, halved

### Decoration

* 150ml whipping cream
* 50g flaked almonds, toasted

## Method

* Acquire a shallow 2.25l glass bowl

### Custard

* First, make the custard. Whisk together the egg yolks, cornflour and sugar in a large bowl
* Heat the milk and cream together in a pan until almost-boiling
* Gradually whisk into the yolks then return the mixture to the pan
* Stir over a high heat until the mixture just comes to the boil and the custard thickens
* Take off the heat, cover, and allow to cool

### Filling

* Split the sponges and spread with jam
* Sandwich together and arrange in the base of the dish
* Crumble the amaretti over the top
* Combine 150ml pear juice from the tin with the sherry, and sprinkle over the sponge
* Level and press down the sponge with a spoon
* Drain the pears and cut each in half lengthways, then arrange over the sponge
* Scatter the grapes over the top
* Spread the cooled custard over the fruit
* Cover and leave until completely cold before transferring to the fridge to chill and set

### Decoration

* Beat the whipping cream until just stiff enough to hold a soft floppy shape
* Gently spread over the surface of the set custard
* Cover and chill until ready to serve

## Notes

* Used about half the filling quantities
