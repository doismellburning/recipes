## Ingredients

* 250g crunchy peanut butter
* 4 tbsp maple syrup
* 2 tbsp ground almonds (or less, depending on PB thickness)
* 0.5 tsp salt
* 6 tbsp rice crispies

## Method

* Mix everything that isn't chocolate
* If it feels too runny, add more ground almonds
* If it feels too thick, add more maple syrup
* Shape into small balls
* Melt the chocolate
* Dip the balls into the melted chocolate to coat (a fork will be useful) then place on a baking tray lined with baking paper
* Put in freezer for around 15-30 minutes until set
* Store in the fridge

## Notes

* Vegan
* [Vegan bacon-flavoured chocolate exists](http://www.rescuechocolate.com/products/fakin-bacon)
